### hey

Vinayak. been building backend systems for a while -- payments, risk, the parts where getting it wrong costs real money.

lately spending time on open-source security. finding bugs in code everyone trusts, fixing what I can, disclosing the rest.

most of my own work lives at [1mb-dev](https://github.com/1mb-dev) -- small Go and Node libraries, nothing fancy, just tools that do one thing well.

Go mostly, some Python and Node. PostgreSQL when the data matters.

open to interesting problems and collaborations.
